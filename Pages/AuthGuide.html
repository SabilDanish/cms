                    <h5>Open Access Policy</h5>
                    <p>
                       Our journals are actively engaged with Open Access (OA), which plays an
                        important role in allowing us to fulfil our mission of furthering the
                        advancement of learning, knowledge and research worldwide. All research
                        articles published in Reseapro journals are fully open access: immediately
                        freely available to read, download and share. Articles are published under
                        the terms of a Creative Commons license which permits use, distribution
                        and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly
                        cited.

                    <h5>Withdrawal Policy</h5>
                    <p>
                        The Withdrawal Policy of Reseapro Journals underscores a commitment to publication ethics and resource-efficient practices in the publication process. The policy mandates authors to submit a letter to the Editorial Office, signed by all authors, elucidating the reasons for withdrawal. Authors who choose to withdraw their accepted papers will be subject to a standardized withdrawal charge of 250 USD. This fee applies to any withdrawal subsequent to official acceptance for publication and covers administrative expenses associated with manuscript processing. Once an article has been accepted and published, the article publication charges become non-refundable in the event of withdrawal. This withdrawal charge is uniformly applicable to all authors, serving as a deterrent against frequent or impromptu withdrawals post-acceptance. The Editorial Office will issue a formal letter of manuscript withdrawal only after the withdrawal charge is paid. The policy ensures responsible manuscript handling and resource allocation.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Correction Notice</h5>
                    <p>
                       A Correction notice will be issued when it is necessary to correct an error or omission, where the interpretation of the article may be impacted but the scholarly integrity or original findings remain intact.<br/><br/>A correction notice, where possible, should always be written and approved by all authors of the article. On very rare occasions where there is a need to correct an error made in the publication process, the journal may be required to issue a correction without the authors’ direct input. However, should this occur, the journal will make its best efforts to notify the authors.<br/><br/>Please note that correction requests may be subject to full review, and if queries are raised, you may be expected to supply further information before the correction is approved. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h5>Retractions</h5>
                    <p>
                        A Retraction will be issued where a major error (e.g., in the methods or analysis) invalidates the conclusions in the article or where it appears research or publication misconduct has taken place (e.g., research without required ethical approvals, fabricated data, manipulated images, plagiarism, duplicate publication, etc.).<br/><br/>The decision to retract an article will be made in accordance with both journal policies and COPE guidelines. The COPE guidance can be found <a href="https://publicationethics.org/retraction-guidelines" target="_blank">here</a><br/><br/>
                        Retractions will be considered in cases where:<br/></p><span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is clear evidence that the findings are unreliable, either as a result of misconduct (e.g., data fabrication or image manipulation) or honest error (e.g., miscalculation or experimental error).</li>
                            <li>The findings have previously been published elsewhere without proper referencing, permission, or justification (e.g., cases of redundant or duplicate publication).</li>
                            <li>The research constitutes plagiarism beyond the accepted limit.</li>
                            <li>The Editor no longer has confidence in the validity or integrity of the article.</li>
                            <li>There is evidence or concerns of authorship for sale.</li>
                            <li>There is evidence of compromised peer review or systematic manipulation.</li>
                            <li>There is evidence of unethical research or there is evidence of a breach of editorial policies.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Where the decision has been taken to retract an article, our journal will:</p>
                         <ul>
                            <li>Add a “retracted” watermark to the final published version of the article.</li>
                            <li>Issue a separate retraction statement, titled ‘[article title] [Retraction]’, that will be linked to the retracted article on the journal’s website.</li>
                            <li>Paginate and make available the retraction statement in the online issue of the journal.</li>
                        </ul></span>

                    <h5>Article Removal</h5>
                    <p>
                       An Article Removal will be issued in rare circumstances where the problems cannot be addressed through a Retraction or Correction notice. Our journal will consider the removal of a published article in very limited circumstances where: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The article contains content that could pose a serious risk of harm if acted upon or followed.</li>
                        <li>The article contains content that violates the rights to privacy of a study participant.</li>
                        <li>The article is defamatory or infringes other legal rights.</li>
                        <li>An article is subject to a court order.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <p>In the case of an article being removed from the journal, a removal notice will be issued in its place.</p>
